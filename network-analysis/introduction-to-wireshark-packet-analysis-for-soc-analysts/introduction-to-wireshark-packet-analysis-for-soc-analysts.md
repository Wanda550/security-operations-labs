# Introduction to Wireshark – Packet Analysis for SOC Analysts

## 🎯 Objective

Introduction to Wireshark. A powerful packet analysis tool used by SOC analysts to investigate network traffic. Learning the interface, how to capture packets, apply filters, and identify suspicious communication patterns.

## 🖥️ Requirements

**Systems:**  

- Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS
- Network Adapter: Required for packet capture  

**Tools:**  

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (latest stable version)

## 📘 **What is Wireshark?**

**Wireshark** is an open-source network protocol analyzer that lets you capture and interactively browse network traffic. It allows analysts to view data packets flowing in and out of a system in real time or from saved PCAP files.

## 🛡️ **Wireshark Use Cases for SOC Analysts**

- 🔍 **Incident Investigation:** Analyze malicious traffic patterns (e.g., C2 communication, lateral movement)
- 🕵️ **Malware Analysis:** Extract indicators like domains, IPs, and payloads from suspicious network behavior
- 🚨 **Threat Hunting:** Detect anomalies like DNS tunneling, beaconing, or unauthorized FTP/SSH usage
- 🛠️ **Protocol Troubleshooting:** Identify service failures, misconfigurations, or latency issues
