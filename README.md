🛡️ Security Operations Labs

A comprehensive collection of Blue Team, SOC Analyst, and Defensive Security labs designed to simulate real-world cyber defense workflows.
This repository documents my practical hands-on learning across multiple areas of cybersecurity, including:

## TOPICS COVERED

🔍 Log Analysis (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, PowerShell abuse)

📊 SIEM Detection (Wazuh, ELK Stack, alert tuning, rule creation)

🌐 Network Analysis (Wireshark, PCAP investigations, threat hunting)

🚨 Incident Response (triage, artifacts, containment procedures)

✉️ Phishing Analysis (email header analysis, malicious URLs, attachments)

🖥️ EDR Basics (endpoint telemetry, behavioral detection, MITRE ATT&CK)

## Each lab includes:

✔️ Attack or scenario simulation
✔️ Steps taken to analyze or detect activity
✔️ Screenshots and logs
✔️ Tools used
✔️ Findings, lessons learned, and detection logic

This repository serves as both a learning journal and a professional Blue Team portfolio, demonstrating my ability to analyze threats, investigate alerts, and apply defensive security concepts in a realistic environment.
